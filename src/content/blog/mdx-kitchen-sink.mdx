Welcome to the ultimate showcase of the portfolio's blog capabilities. This document demonstrates the full range of supported MDX components, ensuring a premium technical reading experience.

## 1. Typography & Hierarchy

Headings are styled with a modern, elegant aesthetic. They support automatic ID generation for deep linking.

### Blockquotes & Highlights

> "The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life."
> — Mark Weiser

We also support nested lists for structured documentation:

*   **Primary Tier**
    *   Secondary detail with *italics*.
    *   Another detail with **bold** text.
*   **Secondary Tier**
    1.  Ordered item one.
    2.  Ordered item two.

## 2. Technical Capabilities

### Mathematical Equations

The blog supports both inline and block equations using $\LaTeX$ syntax through KaTeX.

**Inline Math:** The famous equation $E = mc^2$ relates energy and mass.

**Block Math:**
The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that describes the wave function or state function of a quantum-mechanical system:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

### Code Highlighting

Our code blocks support syntax highlighting and language tags. Here is a Python snippet:

```python
def calculate_quantum_variance(wave_function):
    """
    Calculates the variance of a given quantum state.
    """
    variance = sum([abs(psi)**2 for psi in wave_function])
    print(f"Calculated Variance: {variance}")
    return variance
```
