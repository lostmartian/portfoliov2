# Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

> "The Game of Life is not a game in the conventional sense. There are no players, and no winning or losing. Once the 'board' is set up, the game plays itself."

## The Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

### Rules Summary

1.  **Underpopulation**: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
2.  **Survival**: Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.  **Overpopulation**: Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
4.  **Reproduction**: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

## Interactive Simulation

Below is a live simulation of the Game of Life. You can interact with it by tapping or dragging to spawn cells!

## Patterns

Many different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are classified according to their behaviour.

*   **Still lifes**: Patterns that do not change from one generation to the next.
*   **Oscillators**: Patterns that return to their initial state after a finite number of generations.
*   **Spaceships**: Patterns that translate themselves across the grid.

### Code Example

Here is a simple implementation of the cell update logic in Python:

```python
def update_cell(grid, x, y):
    neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)
    if grid[x][y] == 1:
        if neighbors < 2 or neighbors > 3:
            return 0
        else:
            return 1
    else:
        if neighbors == 3:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
```

## Conclusion

The Game of Life demonstrates how complex behaviors can emerge from very simple rules. It has applications in computer science, physics, biology, and beyond.
