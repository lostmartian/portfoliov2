# Mastering MDX

In the previous article, we touched upon why MDX matters. Now, let's look at how to master it.

## Advanced Image Techniques

Using the `BlogImage` component, we can add captions and ensure images are optimized and responsive.

    caption="A clean workspace leads to clean code." 
/>

## Technical Deep Dive

When writing technical content, the ability to show code alongside explanations is vital.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const BlogHeader = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <header className="py-10 border-b border-gray-800">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">{title}</h1>
    </header>
  );
};
```

## Integrating Third-Party Content

With custom YouTube components, you can bring expert knowledge directly into your post without the performance hit of standard iframes until the user is ready to watch.
