# The Evolution of the Web

The landscape of web development is shifting at an unprecedented pace. What used to be simple HTML and CSS has evolved into complex, dynamic environments that blur the line between applications and experiences.

## Why MDX Matters?

MDX allows you to write JSX in your markdown files. This means you can embed interactive components directly into your content.

```javascript
// Example of a custom component
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span style={{
    backgroundColor: color,
    borderRadius: '2px',
    color: '#fff',
    padding: '0.2rem',
  }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);
```

## Rich Media Support

Supporting rich media is no longer optional. It's essential for engaging storytelling.

### Video Support
We support native video backgrounds and GIF-like behaviors for subtle animations.

### YouTube Integration
Easily embed YouTube videos with a custom thumbnail preview and play interaction.

## Proper Hierarchy and Typography

The blog uses the same typography scale as the rest of the website, ensuring a consistent brand experience. Headings follow a strict hierarchy to help with SEO and readability.

### Code Snippets with Language Tags
Our code blocks show clearly which language is being used, with syntax highlighting optimized for our deep-space theme.

```python
def greet_the_future():
    future_tech = ["AI", "Quantum", "MDX"]
    for tech in future_tech:
        print(f"Embrace {tech}!")

greet_the_future()
```
